in life you have to stand for something. it does not matter what, but something, the truth, making the world a better place, seeing reality for what it is, promoting psychedelics, freedom, whatever. 
there are many ways and things one could do to create a life worth dying forno matter the condition, handicap, mental illness, narrative or whatnot, and that is what nowadays is term as mindset, altthough forever has been called "Life philosofy".
in this episode I will walk you through perhaps one of the most crucial breackthrough pillars of my life phoilosofy, with this, I've managed to "cure" or at least managed the symptoms of, to a point in which I could no longer mind them, things that a clinical heath proffessional would have coined as manic depression, HDHD, paranoid personality disorder, self harm, social anxiety and CPTSD.
so I was fustrated, in one of those pits from which everything hurts and is difficult to reason anywhere outside of your self pity.
And so it came to me that I was taking something for granted, I was thinking from the framework of "everyone else with authority is right about me". 
What if the mental health industry has not yet understood that the paradigm they work from is wrong? In that case, their lapidating "there is no cure for XY mental disorder" would really mean "We have no idea how to cure XY mental disorder", more even, what if "mental disorder" is the wrong way to look at human cognition? How would I know this? how would you know this? Here is the thing, you wouldn't.
>"By the way, when you practice this tipe of challenging thinking, you are practicing something called Skepticism; so you know."

So, for a second, contemplate that no matter what I know about life, about psycology, or the mind, I have absolutely no idea about Your Life, about your experience. I dont know what you thought when someone came a long and punihsed you, I don't know what did other commented next day when you seemed hurt, and even if I knew, I wouldn't know whow did it felt in your body, what was your internal chatter, nor what believes you unconsciously created. Also think that there is no way for you to even express all that complexity. you wouldn't even recall all the oaths and rules you created, all the conversations you had with yourself while walking down the street, nor how influential they where, the facial expressions of dissapointment... Damn, you cannot even descrive with words the face of anyone at all, much less what happens in the black box of your mind.
So now, reflect on the fact that all this details are indeed involved in what has put you in the current situation, and none of that can be known, there is no book on earth explaining the actual reasons of why you feel X Y. In other words, only **you** do. 
anyone, no matter what they have lived or studied, can only have an educated guess, at best.
Now that is about the past, and therefore cannot be changed. let's look into the present. Throw away all the mental models that you hold from others for a second, let go of whatever name, tag or definition someone else has created that you use to name whatever problem you have. Good, what do you have left? What is your particular experience of the problem? Make a list of the things that happen or you somehow do or experience that are in the way of what you are after. You experience thoughts? in what form? images, scenes, clips? Do you react emotionally to those thoughts? you experience things that others cannot percieve? is a voice in your head, a feeling of void in your chest, incontrolable self talk or emotional outbursts? What? 
> What we are doing here is studying what ills us, using first principles

Now, you have that in one hand, you are the only one with the knowledge of what put you here, and in the other, that you are the only one that has access to what is really ailing you. 
Lastly I want you think about the fact that no one on earth is suffering your pain, they are Your memories, your wellbeing, your guilt, your whatever, I want you to recognize that no one else is going to sleep today feeling your void in your chest, and even if they would, that would not change your experience. In other words, Own your inner experience, because you cannot change what you don't own or what you have no responsibility over.
Now, If you call it a problem, is because there is a part of you that can imagine a life without it, so on your reflections, do not identify with let's say "I am insecure" but  "I have insecurity" if that is the case.  So, realize that here, you are making an inventory of all the things that you want to let go of one way or another.
An this is how you close the triangle, only you know what put you here, only you know what it feels to be you, and only you have the control over it. So now you can choose to take full ownership of your cognition.
